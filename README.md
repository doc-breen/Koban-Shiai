My first web game, a very simple project I did to learn Control nodes in Godot 3.4

Godot is an Open Source game engine designed for quick and easy development.  While it has 2D and 3D capabilities, it excels at 2D where it easily competes with other engines on the market, and is beginning to gain some respect for mobile app development as well.
